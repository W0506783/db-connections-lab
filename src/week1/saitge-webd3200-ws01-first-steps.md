## Workshop Activities

### 1. Install & Configure VS Code

1. Download and install **Visual Studio Code** (if not already installed).

   * [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. Install the following VS Code extensions:

   * **Python** (if using Python stack)
   * **C# Dev Kit** (if using .NET stack)
   * **SQLTools** + **SQLTools PostgreSQL Driver** (to connect directly to Postgres inside VS Code)
   * **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues** (for repo integration)
   * **Prettier** (for code formatting)
3. Test your environment:

   * Open a new terminal in VS Code.
   * Run `python --version` or `dotnet --version` to confirm your runtime is installed.

---

### 2. Install & Configure PostgreSQL + pgAdmin

1. Download and install **PostgreSQL** (latest stable version) with **pgAdmin 4**:

   * [https://www.postgresql.org/download/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
2. During setup, choose a **superuser password** you will remember.
3. Open **pgAdmin 4** â†’ Connect to the default server (`localhost`).
4. Create a new database named:

   ```
   course_project
   ```
5. Verify you can query the database:

   ```sql
   SELECT version();
   ```

---

### 3. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Create a new repository named:

   ```
   dbas3200-project
   ```

   * Set visibility to **Private** (recommended).
3. Clone it locally from VS Code:

   * Open Command Palette â†’ `Git: Clone`.
4. Inside the repo, create the following structure:

   ```
   /src
   /migrations
   /docs
   README.md
   ```
5. Commit & push your initial setup:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial project setup"
   git push
   ```

---

### 4. Initialize Migration Tool (Starter Setup)

Depending on your language stack:

* **Python + SQLAlchemy + Alembic**

  ```bash
  pip install sqlalchemy psycopg2 alembic
  alembic init migrations
  ```

* **.NET + Entity Framework Core**

  ```bash
  dotnet add package Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL
  dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
  dotnet ef database update
  ```

* **Node.js + Sequelize**

  ```bash
  npm install sequelize pg pg-hstore
  npx sequelize-cli init
  ```

ðŸ“Œ *For this week, just ensure migrations folder and configuration exist â€” weâ€™ll build real models later.*

---

### 5. Lab: Build & Test a Connection String

1. Use your DB credentials to form a connection string.

   **General PostgreSQL format:**

   ```
   postgresql://<username>:<password>@localhost:5432/course_project
   ```

2. Write a short script that connects and runs a test query.

   **Python example (psycopg2):**

   ```python
   import psycopg2

   conn = psycopg2.connect(
       dbname="course_project",
       user="postgres",
       password="yourpassword",
       host="localhost",
       port="5432"
   )

   cur = conn.cursor()
   cur.execute("SELECT NOW();")
   print("Current time:", cur.fetchone())

   conn.close()
   ```

3. Save this file as `/src/test_connection.py`.

4. Run the script in VS Code terminal:

   ```bash
   python src/test_connection.py
   ```

5. Confirm the output prints the current database time.

6. Commit and push your working code to GitHub.

---

## Deliverables

* Working script that connects to PostgreSQL and prints a timestamp.
* Updated **README.md** containing:

  * IDE + extensions used
  * DB setup method (Postgres + pgAdmin)
  * Steps followed to connect successfully

---

## Reflection (create a reflection text file and add the questions below with answers)

1. What steps went smoothly, and where did you get stuck?
2. How does PostgreSQL + pgAdmin compare to other DB tools youâ€™ve used (if any)?
3. What risks are associated with committing connection strings to GitHub?
4. What habits (repo organization, documentation, testing) from today will help you in professional software projects?

---

At the end of this workshop, you will have:

* A clean repo on GitHub,
* PostgreSQL + pgAdmin running locally,
* A migration tool initialized,
* A working DB connection script you can reuse in future labs.
